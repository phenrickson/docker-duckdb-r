# Portable Data pipelines with Docker, DuckDB, and R

This project showcases the integration of Docker, DuckDB, and R to create efficient and portable data pipelines. By using Docker, we ensure a consistent environment across different machines, while DuckDB provides fast, in-process SQL analytics. The R programming language, along with the {duckdb}, {dbplyr}, and {targets} packages, is used to orchestrate and run the data processing tasks. The {renv} package is used alongside Docker to manage R package dependencies, ensuring reproducibility.
